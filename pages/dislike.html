          <p>
            Blobfish look almost unrecognizable underwater: These tadpole-shaped
            fish have bulbous heads, large jaws, tapered tails, and feathery
            pectoral fins. Rather than scales, they have loose, flabby skin.
            They don't have strong bones or thick muscleâ€”instead, they rely on
            the water pressure to hold their shape together. I dislike it
            becasue it's ugly af. LIKE LOOK AT THAT, WHAT ARE THOSE!!!!!

          <h2>english academie</h2>
          <p>
            English Academy is TOTALY an interactive, online course that
            cultivates children's interest in English language learning.
            Students from primary school follow the story of children and their
            teachers as they communicate in reading, writing, listening, and
            speaking. I dislike this because it's a waste of time and it is a
            waste of living time and money.

          <h2>H.W.</h2>
          <p>
            Homework is an important part of a student's education as it helps
            in developing various core skills that serve them a lifetime. It
            reinforces learning and helps students retain and understand the
            material better. I dislike it becasue it takes to much time to do
            it.

          <h2>Ronaldo</h2>
          <p>
            He was born in Portugal. He grew up in his hometown called Madeira
            and when he was twelve he moved to Lisbon. He always had a passion
            over football since his childhood. Ronaldo started his football
            career as a youth player for Andorinha, he played for two years
            there then later he went to C.D. I dislike him becasue he is gready
            and he is very mean and he is bad at his job.

          <h2>School</h2>
          <p>
            What is the short description of school? Schools are organized
            spaces purposed for teaching and learning. The classrooms where
            teachers teach and students learn are of central importance.
            Classrooms may be specialized for certain subjects, such as
            laboratory classrooms for science education and workshops for
            industrial arts education. I dislike it because... OH NO NOT AGAIN
            MY MOM IS SPANKING ME FOR NOT LIKING SCHOOL OOF
